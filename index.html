                <h2>Info On Me:</h2>
                <p>I am a 15-year-old developer who enjoys discussing programming projects and chatting with friends. While I have released a few projects, most of them are still stored on my HDD. When it comes to communication, I primarily use Discord and prefer to avoid other platforms unless absolutely necessary.</p>
                <p>I have a strong focus on user privacy and safeguarding my data. Below, I share some tips on protecting your own data. However, I recommend consulting a professional for advanced methods.</p>

                <h2>Privacy Methods</h2>
                <article>
                    <h3>Method 1: Use a Privacy-Focused Browser</h3>
                    <p>Avoid browsers like Brave and Opera. Both use Chromium, which ties back to Google. My browser of choice is <strong>Firefox</strong>, which is open-source and committed to privacy. It uses the <em>Gecko</em> engine, ensuring independence and community-driven development.</p>
                    <p>For search engines, consider alternatives to Google. While it offers convenience, I prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo#Bangs" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> for its <em>!bangs</em> feature, which allows quick navigation to various sites.</p>

                    <h3>Method 2: Encrypt Your Communications</h3>
                    <p>Use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Element (Matrix). These apps ensure that only the sender and receiver can read the messages, making it nearly impossible for third parties to intercept your conversations.</p>

                    <h3>Method 3: Secure Your Devices</h3>
                    <p>Keep your devices updated with the latest security patches. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. For extra protection, consider using a password manager to securely store your credentials.</p>

                    <h3>Method 4: Protect Your Network</h3>
                    <p>Use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic and mask your IP address. Choose a VPN provider that doesnâ€™t log your activity and has a good reputation for privacy.</p>
